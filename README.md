# Airport_simulation
Simplified simulation of planes arrivals and departures at the airport

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- libaries:  random, numpy, matplotib

## Description
This is very simplified airport simulation, where planes are from specified number of categories, which determine time needed to operate that plane at the airport. Also, from the moment that plane lands to time it tooks off, the runway is not available to any other plane to land or fly off. Number of runways, time needed to serve plane of each specific type and duration of simulation are given. Number of planes that visit airport is drawn from either normal or uniform distribution.
